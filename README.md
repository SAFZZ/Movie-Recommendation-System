# Movie Recommendation System Data Warehouse Project
This is a data warehousing project that aims to develop an effective movie recommendation system based on users' viewing history. The project uses the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset available on Kaggle.

# Project Steps
Note- We have renamed the dataset from the source name to "movies_df" for convenience
## Step 1: Data Cleaning
The dataset contained missing values and inconsistent data types, which were cleaned using Pandas and Numpy libraries. The missing values were either dropped or filled with the mean of the column. The inconsistent data types were converted to the correct format.

## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset was explored using visualizations and statistical analysis techniques to gain insights into the data. The analysis included identifying the most popular genres, top-rated movies, and the distribution of ratings.

## Step 3: Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed to make it ready for model building. The features were encoded and scaled using LabelEncoder and StandardScaler respectively.

## Step 4: Model Building
A linear regression model was built using Scikit-learn library to predict the ratings of the movies. However, due to some issues, the model could not be completed.

# Conclusion
The project has successfully completed the data cleaning, EDA, and preprocessing steps. However, due to some challenges, the model building step could not be completed. Despite this, the work done so far provides a solid foundation for future development of the movie recommendation system.
